# Local authentication control
# Set to "true" to enable local OIDC endpoints for development
# Defaults to "false" if not set
# WARNING: ALLOW_LOCAL_AUTH must NEVER be enabled in production environments.
# The backend will reject startup if DEPLOYMENT_ENV=production and ALLOW_LOCAL_AUTH=true

# Note: The auth system supports two modes:
# 1. Development mode: Uses AUTH_TOKEN (hardcoded secret string)
# 2. Production mode: Uses AUTH_ISSUER (OIDC provider URL)
#
# In production mode, the frontend should be configured with:
# - VITE_AUTH_ISSUER: The OIDC issuer URL
# - VITE_CLIENT_ID: Your OAuth client ID
#
# The backend expects RS256 JWT tokens from the OIDC provider.

# Cloudflare Access headers for service-to-service authentication with Projects service
# These are optional - only needed if you want to test Cloudflare Access authentication locally
# CLOUDFLARE_SERVICE_TOKEN_CLIENT_ID="your-client-id"
# CLOUDFLARE_SERVICE_TOKEN_CLIENT_SECRET="your-client-secret"
