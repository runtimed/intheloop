# What Works Today

### 🌎 AI Integration

- Models see both code and execution results (not just source)
- AI can create and modify cells with approval system
- Multi-provider support: OpenAI, Ollama, Groq
- Context-aware responses based on notebook state

### 🔄 Persistent Computation

- Outputs survive runtime crashes, browser restarts, network drops
- Event-sourced architecture preserves every change
- Work offline, sync when connected
- Rich multimedia outputs: plots, tables, terminal colors, images

### 👥 Real-Time Collaboration

- Multiple users editing simultaneously without conflicts
- Live presence indicators and collaborative cursors
- Mobile-responsive design for editing anywhere
- Share notebooks by copying the URL

### 🚀 Runtime Flexibility

- **External agents** for production compute integration
- **In-browser HTML** for immediate prototyping
- **In-browser Python** for self-contained data science
- Soft shutdown preserves state across runtime switches

### 🛠 Development Experience

- Integrated dev server (no separate backend process needed)
- Hot reload for UI changes
- Comprehensive testing with integration coverage
- Bundle analysis and performance monitoring
